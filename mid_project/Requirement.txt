Package requirement: pytorch, albumentation,timm,seaborn,hiddenlayer,tqdm,grad-cam,cv2,tkinter

data-code:
    cam: grad-cam method to visualize
    Dataset_BUSIï¼štraining subset
    Chosen model: the python file used to make net-pkl
    Image save: To visualize the images after train_transform
    loss: focal loss
    model: build stacking model
    Class net: We apply the CNN in class 2,3 by this file, each time we just change method in albumentations and the model defined.
    my dataset2: data set method for Class net
    my dataset1: data set method for train_cnn
    train_cnn: models in class 1, each time we change the net defined
    resnet 18: model of resnet 18
    upload: file to make the software
